## Current Process
- Asana (Again) => Moving to Trello (were on trello, asana, trello)
  - Biggest challenge has been mutual engagement from Developers/Management in same tool/process
- Batchbook (CRM) (Previously using capsule crm)
  - Weakness: No mobile app
  - Strength: Robust, simple-to-use toolset

Weak Point: Onboarding
- needs followup

Strong Point: Standups
- This is literally the reason this group seems to be succeeding

Weak point: Process
- Currently, not everyone is onboard with the process and the group needs to agree on something where they can all have buy-in

Strong point: Clients
- Currently some well connected individuals and companies

Strong point: Plenty of work
- A few string clients seem to be carrying the business

Weak Point: Development enviroments
- Developers cannot deploy and manage their own environments
- Developers are not using a consistent environment
- Customer Projects are currently modified live or on staging sites only

Solutions
- Agree to a process tool and a process and identify roles and responsibilities about them
- Deploy a development environment to developer equipment
- Create and document a development process that includes feature branches and code review
- Reassess soon
